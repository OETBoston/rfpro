### Overview

These tasks involve implementing schema changes to support feedback and review functionalities. Updates to the chat and session handlers are complete, while the feedback handler still requires updates, and a new review handler needs to be created. Feedback UI changes are underway, including workflows for both positive and negative feedback and the ability to display previous feedback. The sessions review panel requires a preview UI, panel layout, and filtering options. Similarly, the feedback review panel needs filtering options to enhance usability.
